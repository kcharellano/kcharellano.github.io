KevinDB is a distributed systems project that functions as a key-value store. Meaning, it supports basic key-value operations like GETS and PUTS. However, under the hood KevinDB is implemented as a collection of servers/nodes working together. KevinDB uses replication to deal with faults and maintains data consistency through the use of vector clocks. Nodes communicate with other using HTTP.
