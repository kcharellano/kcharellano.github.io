HuluParty is a Hulu video synchronizer created to allow multiple people to synchronize their shows/movies with eachother. It is made up of two components: a chrome extension and a web server. The chrome extension forms the interace and is responsible for creating sessions, and sending synchronization updates to the server. The web server is an intermediary that stores session data and delegates synchronization updates.
