WERT is a reinforcement learning project inspired by the notorious 2008 web browser game [QWOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWOP). The objective is to move a ragdoll-type player forward using four actions -- *dubbed w, e, r, t*. What makes this game difficult is the unintuitive nature of how each action affects the players legs. Thus, the goal of this project is to use reinforcement learning to teach a model how to successfully play the game.
